# 🧠 Expected Goals (xG) Model — World Cup 2022

This project builds an Expected Goals (xG) model from scratch using open data from StatsBomb’s 2022 FIFA World Cup dataset. The goal is to understand the factors influencing goal likelihood and replicate a simplified version of the models used in modern football analytics.

## 📦 What’s Included

- ✅ Data extraction from StatsBomb open-data repo
- 🧹 Data cleaning and feature selection
- 📐 Feature engineering (shot distance, shot angle)
- 📊 Exploratory data visualizations (e.g. shot maps, distributions)
- 🧮 [Coming Soon] xG model using Logistic Regression

## 📁 Folder Structure

## 📌 Goal

By the end of the project, you'll have a functional xG model, a better grasp of football analytics concepts, and a public example of applied data science in sports.
