## Introduction

In football, the goal count is king. But what if it‚Äôs lying to us?

Raw goal totals tell only part of the story. They ignore context‚Äîshot difficulty, defensive pressure, or angle. In the modern analytics era, that‚Äôs not enough. To understand *how* great a finisher really is, we must ask: **Are they consistently scoring more than they should?**

This project sets out to do just that. By building a custom Expected Goals (xG) model, we go beyond the highlight reels to quantify finishing skill with precision. Our focus: two generational forwards‚Äî**Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp√©**.

## The Verdict: Consistent, Elite Overperformance

Using four years of publicly available FBRef data, the findings are unambiguous: both players are elite finishers, consistently outperforming expected goals. 

- **Kylian Mbapp√©:** +18 Goals Above Expected (G-xG)
- **Lionel Messi:** +5.4 Goals Above Expected (G-xG)

This means that, compared to a league-average player taking the same shots, both have delivered *more* goals‚Äîand by margins that aren‚Äôt due to chance.

## The Deeper Story: Uncovering Finishing Signatures

While both overperform, *how* they do so is where it gets fascinating.

By comparing our custom xG model to StatsBomb‚Äôs industry benchmark, we reveal two distinct **finishing archetypes**. These aren't just statistical quirks‚Äîthey are signatures, shaped by style, situation, and skillset.

## Deep Dive 1: Mbapp√©, The ‚ÄúDynamic Finisher‚Äù

Mbapp√©'s finishing profile is explosive, unpredictable‚Äîand nearly unmodelable.

The custom model systematically **undervalued** his chances. Why? Because it couldn't see what the eye can: breakneck sprints, instinctive shots, and finishes in chaotic, high-pressure moments. These are scenarios that demand more advanced tracking data to capture fully. Mbapp√© thrives in *motion*, and his goals often emerge from volatility.

## Deep Dive 2: Messi, The ‚ÄúTechnical Maestro‚Äù

Messi, on the other hand, plays geometry.

Where the models agreed, Messi succeeded‚Äîcreating shot opportunities that are mathematically clean, technically optimal, and beautifully engineered. His shot map suggests a player who manipulates space with clinical precision. Unlike Mbapp√©‚Äôs chaos, Messi‚Äôs brilliance lies in control.
